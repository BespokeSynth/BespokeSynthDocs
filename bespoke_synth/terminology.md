# terminology
<br>

Bespoke synth sometimes uses different terminology than other DAWs or it uses familiar words in unusual way.

There you can find where to look when you are looking for something:

- **control voltage** - pulse
- **filter** - *biquad* or *butterworth* in *effectchain*, but most complex synths has filter already built-in
- **oscillator** - Bespoke oscillator is in fact full featured synth, use *signalgenerator* if you want low level oscillator
- **reverb** - look for *freeverb* in *effectchain*
- **sequencer** - look to *instruments* menu
- **transpose** - use *capo* for transposing notes by semitones, *noteoctaver* for transposing by octave and *transposefrom* for transposing according to scale
- **oscilloscope** - you want *waveformviewer* or *spectrum*
